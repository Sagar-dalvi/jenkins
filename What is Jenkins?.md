### **What is Jenkins?**

**Jenkins** is a tool that helps you automate tasks in software development.
Think of Jenkins as a robot that does repetitive tasks for you, like checking
if your code is correct and sending it out to others.

#### **Example:**
Imagine you're working on a school project. Every time you finish your part,
you want to make sure it works and then send it to your teacher. Instead of 
doing this manually every time, Jenkins does it for you automatically.

### **Why Do We Use Jenkins?**

1. **Saves Time:** Jenkins can automatically check your code, so you don’t have to do it manually.
   
   - **Example:** If you make changes to your project, Jenkins will automatically run tests to see if everything still works.
                 You don’t need to do it yourself.

2. **Catches Problems Early:** Jenkins checks your work right away, so you can fix problems before they get bigger.
   
   - **Example:** If you accidentally make a mistake in your code, Jenkins will catch it immediately and let you know.

3. **Works with Other Tools:** Jenkins can work with tools you already use, like Git, which stores your code.
   
   - **Example:** When you save your work in Git, Jenkins can automatically start checking it.

4. **Customizable:** You can add plugins to Jenkins to make it do even more things.
   
   - **Example:** You can add a plugin that automatically sends your project to a website when it’s ready.

### **Disadvantages of Jenkins**

- **Can Be Complex:** Jenkins can be hard to set up if you’re just starting.
   
   - **Example:** If you’ve never used a tool like Jenkins before, it might take some time to figure out how it works.

- **Needs Regular Care:** Jenkins needs to be updated and maintained to keep running smoothly.
   
   - **Example:** Just like you need to update apps on your phone, you need to update Jenkins to keep it secure and working well.

- **Uses a Lot of Resources:** Running many tasks on Jenkins might slow down your computer.
   
   - **Example:** If Jenkins is running lots of tests at the same time, your computer might get slow.

### **What is a Jenkins Pipeline?**

A **pipeline** in Jenkins is like a series of steps that your project goes through, from start to finish. 

#### **Example:**
Let’s say you’re making a cake. The pipeline would be:

1. **Gather Ingredients:** (Checkout Code)
2. **Mix Ingredients:** (Build)
3. **Bake the Cake:** (Test)
4. **Decorate and Serve:** (Deploy)

In Jenkins, each step is automated. So, when you push your code to Git,
Jenkins will automatically gather the code, mix it (build it), bake it (test it), and then serve it (deploy it).

### **What is CI/CD?**

**CI/CD** stands for **Continuous Integration** (CI) and
**Continuous Deployment** (CD). It’s a way to keep your project
up to date and ready to use at all times.

#### **Example:**
1. **Continuous Integration (CI):** Every time you make changes,
Jenkins automatically checks and tests the whole project to make sure everything works together.
   
   - **Example:** You change one line in your code. Jenkins automatically
                 tests the entire project to make sure your change didn’t break anything.

2. **Continuous Deployment (CD):** Once everything is tested, Jenkins can automatically send the new version of your project to users.
   
   - **Example:** After Jenkins tests and confirms everything is good, it automatically updates the project on the live website so users can see it.

### **What are Jenkins Plugins?**

**Plugins** are like apps you can add to Jenkins to give it more features.

#### **Example:**
- **Git Plugin:** Lets Jenkins automatically pull the latest code from your Git repository.
- **Email Plugin:** Sends you an email if a test fails.
- **Docker Plugin:** Helps Jenkins build and deploy your project in Docker containers.

### **Summary with Example**

Let’s say you’re working on a simple website:

1. **You make changes to the website code.**
2. **Jenkins automatically pulls the new code from Git.**
3. **Jenkins builds the website to make sure the code is correct.**
4. **Jenkins runs tests to check if everything works as expected.**
5. **If all tests pass, Jenkins automatically updates the website for users to see.**

This process is called a **pipeline**, and it’s part of what we call **CI/CD**.
You can add **plugins** to make Jenkins do even more things, like sending you an email if something goes wrong.

This simplified example should make Jenkins and its key concepts easier to understand.
